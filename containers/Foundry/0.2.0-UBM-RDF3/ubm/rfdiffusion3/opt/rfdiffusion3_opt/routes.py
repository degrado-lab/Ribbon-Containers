"""The routes table — the routes a pass runs under, the accelerator words each route expects, and the reader that maps
(mode, design line) to a route. Standard library only: this module loads in the pristine interpreter (the stock child, an outside
runner's stock arm) where the shared core is not necessarily importable; `modes` serves the same names for the kit routes.

  stock    `--mode off` + upstream's `compile_model=true`: upstream's fastest documented environment, pristine interpreter
  default  `--mode off`: upstream exactly as shipped, pristine interpreter
  exact    `--mode exact`: the kit's exact class (compile_model=true refused: COMPILE_UNDER_EXACT)
  fast     `--mode fast`: the kit's tolerance class (compile_model=true refused: COMPILE_UNDER_FAST)

Every row names the expected word KIND of the KERNELS census per accelerator — compile, atom_attn, the two dead surfaces, and `rmsnorm`
(apex's FusedRMSNorm engaged on every route: the pinned stack carries apex, STOCK.md "Pinned stack") — (census.py reads it, restating nothing) and whether the
pre-flight atom-attention decision gates the pass (`preflight_gate`: the KIT routes exact and fast, whose captured / compiled dense step
cannot serve upstream's sparse path — the pass is refused there by name; the stock routes take whatever path upstream's own memory rule
picks, dense or sparse, and the line NAMES it), and whether that decision is authoritative for the process (`attn_pin`: on the kit routes the
pre-flight evaluation of upstream's rule is pinned per attention shape key and every later query of the decision function answers from the
pin; the stock routes keep upstream's per-call evaluation). The stock routes carry no `atom_attn` expectation and `default` no `rmsnorm`
expectation: stock is upstream through its own surface — which attention path it picks, and which RMSNorm class its environment binds
(apex when the interpreter carries it, torch's otherwise), are facts the KERNELS line reports, never misses.
