    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the computational methods used to design esmGFP in [Hayes et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.01.600583). esmGFP has similar brightness and spectral properties as GFPs found in nature despite being a far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins, but we also found many other bright new GFPs with similar or higher sequence identity. One can likely design a lot more new GFPs with the approach sketched in this notebook!\n",

    "This notebook implements the core prompt used to begin the chain of thought used to create esmGFP. The overall process we used differs in two keys ways:\n",
